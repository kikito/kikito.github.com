  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently acquired a new development machine &#8211; A Mac Book Air. I had been resisting it for quite some time now.</p>
<p>It is a very fine machine, but I&#8217;m not familiar with its operative system (I used to use Ubuntu on a custom-made PC).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve spent a couple days installing and configuring it for development usage (mostly Ruby on Rails). Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve done so far:</p>
<h3>Locate the terminal</h3>
<p>I was able to find the terminal using the &#8220;find tool&#8221; (a little magnifier glass near the top right of the screen) and typing &#8220;terminal&#8221;. Once I clicked on it, it appeared on the Dock. I &#8220;left-clicked&#8221; (clicked with two fingers) on it to display a contextual menu. I choose <code>Options &gt; Keep in Dock</code> so I didn&#8217;t have to look for it again.</p>
<h3>Upgraded the Operative System</h3>
<p>A new version of <span class="caps">OSX</span> (codename &#8220;Mountain Lion&#8221;) had been released the day before my laptop arrived. Knowing that updates do sometimes provoke conflict with installed software, the first thing I did after booting up the machine was upgrading its operative system.</p>
<p><span class="caps">OSX</span> comes with a software called &#8220;App Store&#8221;. The upgrade was sold there, and was prominently advertised as well. If you have ever installed one application in a smartphone, the procedure was very similar &#8211; downloading the operative system took some time, since it weighted 4GB.</p>
<p>After the download finished, the computer requested a reboot. I noticed a couple issues:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Mointain Lion comes with a new security &#8220;feature&#8221; that blocks installing software that doesn&#8217;t come from the App Store &#8211; If <span class="caps">OSX</span> complains that &#8220;the developer is using an unkonwn signature&#8221; or something similar, activate the corresponding option in <code>Apple Menu &gt; System Preferences &gt; Security &amp; Privacy &gt; Allow Applications downloaded from: Anywhere</code>.</li>
	<li>I also noticed later on that the encoding is not set by default. This gave me issues later on when I started using ruby and Unicode stuff. In order to fix this, you must remember to add the following to your .profile/.bashrc/.zshrc:<br />
<div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">LANG</span><span class="o">=</span>en_US.UTF-8
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">LC_ALL</span><span class="o">=</span>en_US.UTF-8
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div></notextile></li>
</ul>
<h3>Install gcc for <span class="caps">OSX</span></h3>
<p>Macs come with no compiler installed by default. From what I could understand, the development environment is called &#8220;XCode&#8221;. It&#8217;s a big download, another 4GB (later on I found some claims that you don&#8217;t need to download the whole XCode; the compiler can apparently be downloaded separately.</p>
<p>However, I opted for an alternative approach: I used <a href="https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer/">gcc-for-osx</a> . Installing it is very straightforward; download, double-click business.</p>
<h3>Install ruby</h3>
<p>Once the compiler is in place, you can install ruby. The recommended way to do that is via a ruby version manager. There are two main ones: <code>rvm</code> and <code>rbenv</code>. My personal preference is the former.</p>
<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div></notextile></p>
<p>Once the process finishes downloading and compiling, it is usually a good idea to set the default ruby version. At the time of this writing, it is ruby 1.9.3. So I did this:</p>
<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nb">source</span> ~/.bashrc
</span><span class='line'>rvm use 1.9.3 --default
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div></notextile></p>
<p>Once this is done, you should be able to execute <code>ruby --version</code> and obtain &#8216;1.9.3&#8217;.</p>
<p>I later on installed ruby 1.9.2 since I need it for this blog (which is done in <a href="http://octopress.org">octopress</a> , and it does not work in ruby 1.9.3).</p>
<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>rvm install 1.9.2
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div></notextile></p>
<h3>Install homebrew</h3>
<p>Homebrew is a tool for installing packages from the command line. I think of it as an &#8220;very limited apt-tools package&#8221;. But it&#8217;s the best there is on <span class="caps">OSX</span>, so you might as well install it. Here&#8217;s how you do it:</p>
<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>/usr/bin/ruby -e <span class="s2">&quot;$(/usr/bin/curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/master/Library/Contributions/install_homebrew.rb)&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div></notextile></p>
<p>Once homebrew is installed, you can use it to install other useful packages. For example, git and wget:</p>
<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>brew install git
</span><span class='line'>brew install wget
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div></notextile></p>
<h3>Vim</h3>
<p>Another thing I needed was a better console, and a decent source code editor. I am used to Vim in Ubuntu, so the natural choice in <span class="caps">OSX</span> is using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/macvim/">macvim</a> .</p>
<p>Homebrew has a recipe for installing vim, but it doesn&#8217;t work if you have installed gcc instead of XCode, as I&#8217;ve done. So I had to download it from the website, and manually create a couple aliases (It is explained in the <span class="caps">README</span> file which comes with the download).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m very happy to report that <a href="https://github.com/kikito/adegan">Adegan</a>, my custom Vim configuration, seems to have work very well in macvim. To install it I had to use the same command I use in Ubuntu:</p>
<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>curl -Lo- https://raw.github.com/kikito/adegan/master/scripts/bootstrap.sh | bash
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div></notextile></p>
<h3>iterm2 and zsh</h3>
<p>The default terminal emulator is quite alright, but since I was experimenting, I decided to install it&#8217;s &#8220;cool replacement&#8221;, called <a href="http://www.iterm2.com">iterm2</a> . Again, this was a matter of downloading and double clicking, and then dragging to the Applications folder. Oh, and sticking it into the Dock.</p>
<p>Then I installed zsh, a replacement for bash. I did so from brew:</p>
<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>brew install zsh
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div></notextile></p>
<p>Then I had to tell iterm2 to use zsh by default. That is done via this command:</p>
<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>chsh -s /bin/zsh
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div></notextile></p>
<p>Next time a console is opened, it will use zsh instead of bash.</p>
<p>I then installed ohmyzsh:</p>
<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>curl -L https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh | sh
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div></notextile></p>
<p>It seems that the version I installed by default sets the theme to &#8220;random&#8221;. I edited the <code>~/.zshrc</code> file and set it to &#8220;robbyrussell&#8221;, which I&#8217;m used to.</p>
<h3>Overall experience</h3>
<p>I find that, in terms of installation and configuration, <span class="caps">OSX</span> is intermediate. It is not as bad as Windows, where each piece of software is installed and updated independently, but it is also not as pleasant as Ubuntu, where almost everything is centralized via apt.</p>
<p>I found that some applications required &#8220;double clicking&#8221; to be installed, others had to be &#8220;extracted and copied to the Applications folder&#8221;, while others had an &#8220;special window&#8221; where you could drag the application icon to applications. And then there is the App Store, and Homebrew.</p>
<p>I am also adapting to the US keyboard layout, and doing some experiments. I might post about that soon.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here is one little tip you might not know: programming languages, like spoken languages, have accents.</p>
<p>Well, maybe I&#8217;m stretching the metaphor a bit. But only a bit. So bear with me while I dissert a bit about spoken languages. I promise it won&#8217;t take too long.</p>
<h2>A brief detour on Spoken Languages</h2>
<p>I was born in the southern part of Spain. That region, known as Andalusia, has it&#8217;s own accent. It has a distinct intonation has certain slang, but its most prominent characteristic is the omission of phonemes. I guess, to other Spanish speakers, Andalusian Spanish sounds like a mixture of Scottish and Texas English. It is also kindof considered &#8220;funny by default&#8221;. Some comediants use that accent to tell jokes, even if they don&#8217;t usually speak like that.</p>
<p>In addition to Andalusian, after spending 9 years in Madrid, I have a separate &#8220;compartment&#8221; in my head for Madrid&#8217;s accent, which we could call &#8220;neutral Spanish&#8221;. I change between Andalusian and neutral depending on who I am speaking to.</p>
<p>I also speak English and French. I only have one accent for each of those, but I know them well enough to notice how different accents sound.</p>
<p>This linguistic background has allowed me to notice certain &#8230; differences here and there. Besides the obvious ones, like phonetical or grammatical rules, I mean; more of the semantic kind.</p>
<p>For example, French people (at least people from Paris, which are the ones I&#8217;m more familiar with) don&#8217;t even say &#8220;we&#8221;. I mean, they have a word for it &#8211; &#8220;nous&#8221;. But they never use it when colloquially speaking. Instead, they use the impersonal &#8220;on&#8221;, which roughtly translates to &#8220;it&#8221; (as in &quot;It is said that&#8230; &quot;). So, when they mean &#8220;let&#8217;s go shopping&#8221; they say something like &#8220;it should go shopping&#8221;. Crazy, right? Well, they do it all the time.</p>
<p>What can I say about English? It is so widely used that there are so many things one can say. By hearing how they pronnouce the letter &#8220;r&#8221;, one can say whether someone is from one side or the other of the Atlantic. I wonder if some day &#8220;I wanna go&#8221; will be considered valid English.</p>
<p>In Spain, no one says good-bye any more. There is a word for it, of course &#8211; &#8220;Adiós&#8221;. But no one says it. Everyone says &#8220;see you soon&#8221; instead. Even if it&#8217;s longer. Society has decided that &#8220;Adiós&#8221; is too &#8230; hard, I suppose.</p>
<p>They say eskimos have 7 different words for &#8220;snow&#8221;. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s true. I know that my girlfriend, who grew in the northern part of Spain, has 1 more word than me for saying &#8220;it rains&#8221;, in Spanish.</p>
<h2>The Engineer View</h2>
<p>I like to think that all men of science share a special sense of beauty. Instead of (or in addition to) being able to find beauty in a work of art, we find it in efficient, neatly organized systems and tools.</p>
<p>When I look at spoken languages from the point of view of an engineer, I find them a bit &#8230; lacking. Spoken languages are not a very efficient tool for communicating concepts. They require more effort than it&#8217;s really necessary.</p>
<p>Spanish verbs are crazily ornated. English does it better, but still requires too much memory &#8211; why say &#8220;I am, you are, he is&#8221;, when you could say &#8220;I be, you be, he be&#8221;?. Speaking of English, its pronnounciation rules have too many exceptions and things that one has to remember &#8211; tomato vs potato. That one is much simpler in Spanish. My biggest grip with French is that even if lots of words are pronnounced the same way, they are written differently. The fact that the word &#8220;bureaucracy&#8221; has its roots on that particular language makes a lot of sense.</p>
<h2>Programming languages as tools</h2>
<p>When I look at programming languages, I conserve that sense of beauty. That is why I consider myself very fortunate to be able to work with a programming language that I find aesthetically pleasant as an engineer. I enjoy using the language, and seeing where it takes me.</p>
<p>Lua is another language that I enjoy. It is smaller than ruby, and certainly less powerful, but the compromises it makes reflect what I think an embedded language should do.</p>
<p>Javascript is so ubiquous it hurts!</p>
<p>And of course there are plenty of others. Lisp. Haskell. Erlang. Html. Even <span class="caps">CSS</span>.</p>
<p>And yet, my sense of beauty is never satisfied. Ruby, which is my favourite, is slow in some cases. The way it handles blocks troubles me. Lua has implicit global variables, and its string manipulation library is too barebones. Javascript &#8230; well, I used to enjoy it. After reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742">Javascript: the good parts</a> , however, I can&#8217;t help but keep noticing the bad parts. Lisp doesn&#8217;t feel like a language, it feels like raw <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree"><span class="caps">AST</span></a> manipulation. <span class="caps">PHP</span>&#8230; don&#8217;t get me started on <span class="caps">PHP</span>.</p>
<p>The point is, I have grudges with all of them. It would seem that I am doomed to never be satisfied.</p>
<h2>The accent in programming languages</h2>
<p>But I wanted to talk about the accent in programming languages. As I was saying before, I think that there are &#8220;semantic differences&#8221; between spoken languages. And I think those differences are even more pronnounced in programming languages.</p>
<p>The first programming language I ever learnt was <span class="caps">BASIC</span>, in the mighty <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum#ZX_Spectrum.2B">Spectrum 48k+</a> . Much later, in the University, I learnt C. And I programmed C exactly like I programmed <span class="caps">BASIC</span> before. Then I learnt Java &#8230; and yet, I managed to program it as if it was <span class="caps">BASIC</span>. Only though time, and gradual effort, I managed to &#8220;get&#8221; this new &#8220;way of thinking&#8221; called &#8220;Object orientation&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8230; and then I started to do Object Orientation in plain C. Which was a mistake.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve needed a lot of time to realize that every programming language has its strenghts; and they are often not easily &#8220;exportable&#8221;. This is what I call the &#8220;nature&#8221; of a language. This &#8220;nature&#8221; is not necessarily related with the language&#8217;s grammar rules. For example, Javascript has acquired an &#8220;asyncronous nature&#8221; recently, thanks to <a href="http://nodejs.org">node.js</a> .</p>
<p>To get the nature of a programming language, you probably should not use a grammar book. You will need a book which concentrates on &#8220;idiomatic rules&#8221; instead. Or, you could spend an inordinate amount of time reading other people&#8217;s code.</p>
<p>So, when you learn your next programming language, don&#8217;t stop after you learn the basic grammar rules. Try to concentrate on whether people say &#8220;Adiós&#8221; with it. Or how many ways it has for saying &#8220;snow&#8221;.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve recently started getting interested in <a href="http://golang.org">Go</a> (also known as <em>golang</em>), one of the new programming languages being developed by Google (another one is <a href="http://www.dartlang.org/">DART</a> , but I&#8217;m not interested in that one. Yet).</p>

<p>One of the first hurdles I have encontered is that the <a href="http://golang.org/doc/install#freebsd_linux">installation instructions</a> seem incomplete, at least for Ubuntu.
They tell you to go and download the source code and compile it on your machine. While I&#8217;m not afraid of compiling stuff myself, I&#8217;m not so fond of maintaining the compiled programs up-to-date manually. It reminds me of windows, brr.</p>

<p>When I&#8217;m trying new software I always try to find:</p>

<p>a) The official apt-package with <code>apt-cache search</code>, which will manage the updates for me, or
b) A <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/ubuntu-ppa-technology-explained/">ppa</a> , which is basically the same thing, except that
   instead of an &#8220;official&#8221; unkown Ubuntu guy these updates are managed by an unkown guy.</p>

<p>I tried to find a ppa for golang and, lo and behold! <a href="https://launchpad.net/~gophers/+archive/go">There is one</a>, and it seems reasonably official!</p>

<p>Since the official instructions don&#8217;t mention how to use this wonderful resource, allow me:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Install golang-stagle from the gophers/go ppa</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gophers/go
</span><span class='line'>sudo apt-get update
</span><span class='line'>sudo apt-get install golang-stable
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Easy peasy! No compilations or anything needed. And when Go gets a new version, you will receive it as a software update. Cool!</p>

<p>One minor thing though - Go expects you to have defined a <code>GOPATH</code> environment variable. This variable should point to a place where the Go libraries (&#8220;packages&#8221;, in
Go lingo) are installed. For newbies (like me) it&#8217;s better if it&#8217;s a folder inside your home directory.</p>

<p>So it&#8217;s just a matter of creating it! (I name it <code>.go</code> so it is invisible by default, but you may want to make it more public). Notice that there is no <code>sudo</code> on this line.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Finally, create the environment variable. Add this to your .bashrc, .zshrc or equivalent file, depending on whether you use bash, zsh or other shells.</p>

<p>This is a copy of <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=8608&amp;p=53181#p53181">a post</a> I did recently in the LÖVE forums.</p>

<p>This is not the first time I hear about the &#8220;I don&#8217;t like using libraries&#8221; thing, and I have been thinking about it for a while. I guess this is a good place to expose my views on the matter.</p>
<p>You see, for me there are two kinds of tasks in programming: there is <strong>Cool Stuff</strong> and there is <strong>Yak Shaving</strong>.</p>
<p>In a game, <strong>Cool Stuff</strong> is what your game is about &#8211; it could be a great gameplay. It could be a really neat set of graphics. It could be a really good story. Or very likable characters. Hell, it could be the sound, if you are doing a musical game.</p>
<p>But there is usually lots of extra stuff that you also need for your game to be considered &#8220;complete&#8221;. You need to handle the menu. The animations. You need to store and retrieve information from files, etc.</p>
<p>All that stuff that &#8220;doesn&#8217;t really make your game any cooler, but it&#8217;s still needed&#8221;, is <strong>Yak Shaving</strong>.</p>
<p>The problem is that lots of people (me included) end up not doing the Cool Stuff because they spend all their energy Yak Shaving. That is just sad.</p>
<p>In my opinion, anything that saves you from Shaving a Yak so you can spend time doing <strong>Cool Stuff</strong>, is good.</p>
<p>An example: you are using LÖVE instead of C++ and OpenGL, or direct machine code. And yet it doesn&#8217;t &#8220;feel like cheating&#8221;. That&#8217;s because all LÖVE does is Yak Shaving. But you still need to do your part &#8211; you need to do the Cool Stuff!</p>
<p>In the &#8220;cross the country metaphor&#8221;, using tween should not feel like friend giving you a lift. It should feel like a friend giving you a pair of good walking boots. You put them on and then, off you go! You are still doing the important stuff &#8211; which is walking that long, long path. It&#8217;s only that now you don&#8217;t have to worry about all the little pointy pebbles in the way.</p>
<p>I also want to address the &#8220;<strong>but if I use libraries, I will not learn!</strong>&#8221; concern.</p>
<p>First of all, I think learning is great. I&#8217;m all for learning. And I think that it is a proven fact that learning from others is more effective than having to learn it by yourself. A good teacher will explain the Theory of relativity in one hour. A class full of students, however bright they are, will forcefully take much longer than that to come up with the theory all by themselves.</p>
<p>If you want to learn, that is great! Just don&#8217;t try to go &#8220;macho&#8221; and do it on your own. Open up an existing lib, and see how other people have already done it! Don&#8217;t try to invent relativity, read a book about it! Be efficient!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve learnt so much by reading other people&#8217;s source code. I make a o point to make my libs as understandable as possible, just because of this.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s pretty much it. Sorry for the long rant. I will shut up now.</p></div>

<h2>Why is it forbidden for a function to do two different things?</h2>
<p>There are many reasons. The first one is that functions are supposed to be reusable. If you divide a big function into smaller functions, you can reuse those smaller functions in other places. The other reason is that by giving proper names to those functions, your code looks more like English and less than machine code. It&#8217;s easier to understand for humans.</p>
<p>A big function is like a landscape that one has to explore in order to &#8220;understand&#8221;. When you have smaller functions with significant names, those names act as &#8220;signposts&#8221; indicating where the code &#8220;goes&#8221; to humans.</p>
<h2>What would you use instead?</h2>
<p>If a function does two things, you divide it in two functions, give those functions proper, significant, pronounceable names, and call those functions from the original one.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a big function like this one:</p>
<p>(Note: I&#8217;ll be using my class library, middleclass, tangentially, just to show how a good design and object orientation facilitate making stuff)</p>

<p>Complexity in code comes from functions like this one. When you have lots of functions like this, your code tends to become unmanageable, especially if you return to it after not touching it for several months. It&#8217;s a code that you understand while you are writing, and certainly the machine understands it, but it doesn&#8217;t have &#8220;signposts&#8221; for future visitors. They have to &#8220;explore&#8221; it to know it.</p>
<p>One option is to put a couple comments.</p>

<p>A much, much better solution is extracting those two &#8220;different things&#8221; into functions, ditch the comments, and use better names for the variable while you are at it.</p>
<p>While you are doing this, you will suddenly realize that this function isn&#8217;t really making two things. It&#8217;s doing <strong><span class="caps">LOTS</span></strong> of things. Each one of those things belongs to a different function.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sorry but I could not make <code>Turrent:getNearest</code> any smaller.</p>
<p>Both programs do the same; for the machine, they are no different. But for programmers, they are so much easier to understand and maintain. Take a look at <code>Turret:update()</code>! Isn&#8217;t it just beautiful?</p>
<p>And now that you have smaller functions, you can reuse them in other places. I could move getDistance and getAngle to a Vector class, for example. That way I could use code for calculating distances and angles in all <code>Enemies</code> and <code>Players</code>, not just in my <code>Turret</code> class.</p>
<p>Notice that the <code>Turret</code> is prepared to attack players, but it&#8217;s very easy to subclass it now and create a turret that shoots other things, like asteroids. Actually, let me show you:</p>
<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='lua'><span class='line'><span class="n">AsteroidCleaningTurret</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">class</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;</span><span class="s">AsteroidCleaningTurret&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Turret</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">AsteroidCleaningTurret</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">getTarget</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">self</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">getNearest</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Game</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">asteroids</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div></notextile></p>
<p>That&#8217;s it. If I create an <code>AsteroidCleaningTurret</code>, it&#8217;ll start shooting asteroids. In 4 lines. If the code of <code>Turret:update()</code> was the first version, I would have had to fiddle much more in order to do this. It&#8217;s so easy to modify now! I could make a <code>DrunkenTurret</code> that calculates angles badly. Or one that shoots 4 bullets instead of just one. There&#8217;re so many places you can tweak!</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>And I guess I&#8217;ll just shut up now. I hope I made my point. Each function should do just one thing because that&#8217;s better for the Universe.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Programming is full of acronyms: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle"><span class="caps">KISS</span></a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development"><span class="caps">TDD</span></a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming"><span class="caps">OOP</span></a> . <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_ain&#39;t_gonna_need_it"><span class="caps">YAGNI</span></a> .</p>
<p>In other cases there are short idioms for common concepts: &#8220;<a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PrematureOptimization">Premature optimization is the Root of All Evil</a>&#8221; and <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?GotoConsideredHarmful"><span class="caps">GOTO</span> considered harmful</a></p>
<p>Well, here&#8217;s one little programming principle for which I have not found a popular acronym or short idiom:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Make the common use case simple, and the others possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>a.k.a. <span class="caps">MCUSAOP</span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a programming principle I keep coming back every time I&#8217;m developing a library. I like it is very adequate for that task; the steps to follow are clear: first, find the most common case, or estimate which one is it. Then, design an interface for doing it in the simplest possible way. Then, think about the next most common case, and add an interface for it, trying to minimize its impact on the first case&#8217;s design. Keep doing that until all cases are covered.</p>
